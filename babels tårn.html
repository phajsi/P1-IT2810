      <h1> The tower of babel </h1>
      <br/>
      <p id="italic"> The legend (bible, chapter 6-9 in the book of Genesis, ed.) says, that after the Great Flood (the one with Noah's ark, ed.),
        when the Earths population was still gathered in one place and all spoke one language. The people started to build a tower
        in Shinar (now believed to be Babylonia, ed.). They wanted to build a tower big enough to reach to the heavens, so they built
        and built, day after day, until the tower got pretty tall and the people were very pleased with themselves.
        God seeing this, got angry at the men for wanting to reach Him and be like Him. So, one day, he made the peole speak different tongues,
        so that they couldn't understand each other, thus creating the languages that existed then. With no common language the people scattered
        accross the earth and left the tower in ruins. </p>

        <p>
        The tale of the Tower of Babel has inspired countless of artists throughout time. Adding to the list of artists, this insignificant one
        depicts the tale with only svg, canvas and jquery methods at her disposal.

        <h3> CSS-grid</h3>
        <p> The body element was chosen to be the grid container
        because it seemed like the most sensible choice. The grid lines
      were set to 50px between columns and 5px between rows, because
    more space between columns were needed to create a clearer distinction
    between the main html-elements, header, both drawings and the documentation.
  This creates a cleaner, tidier page design. I wanted to center the main elemnts
both beacause, in my opinion, it creates a minimalistic look for the page but also
to beacause it makes a responsive design in regards to computers with different
creen sizes. Because of this I decided to make three columns, the ones to the sides
got 230px in width and giving the center column automatic sizing. The rows were made
automatic, meaning they will be the size of the elemnts inside them. Finally I decided
a grid template, naming the parts of the grid I was going to put elements in.
This because I knew how I wanted the page to look like, and it made it very easy to
place my elemnts on the grid.   </p>

        <h3>HTML canvas and SVG</h3>
        <p> I used the same method to create the drawings in SVG and HTML canvas. First I made
        js-objects of the differents shapes I wanted to use, to then creates functions for the animated
      parts. </p>
        <h3>jQuery</h3>
        <p>jQuery is used for the clickable objects, to make the buttons activate and toggle
        between functions and to show/hide the documentation. </p>
        <h3>Cross-browser testing</h3>
        <p>The html page has been tested in both Google Chrome and Firefox, and it works as
        intended on both sites.</p>
